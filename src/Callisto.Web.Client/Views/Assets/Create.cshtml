                                            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of
                                            existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.

                                            the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When.
